Hypothesis Bug Report Validation
What You’ll Be Doing

You'll evaluate bug reports generated by an AI system that uses property-based testing to find bugs in Python packages. Your job is to determine whether each report describes a real bug that should be reported to maintainers.
Before You Begin

Review these instructions completely.

You must have web access to browse the codebase the bug report pertains to.

Optional: Set up a Python environment if you want to run reproduction code, including cloning the codebase.
Task

For each bug report, you’ll answer three yes/no questions:

Is this a real bug? The property test failure points to a legitimate issue in the behavior of the code.
Would maintainers welcome this bug report? The report is accurate, and the bug is worth their time to address.
Is this a security issue? The bug report flags behavior that could lead to malicious exploitation.

For each question, you’ll also provide a confidence rating (1-5) to indicate your certainty.

Timing
Average Handling Time (AHT): 45 minutes per evaluation.
Use the time budget strategically: start with documentation and code search, run code if needed, and finalize when the answer is clear.

Step by Step Process

Read the Bug Report Carefully.
Review the summary and claimed issue
Examine the property-based test that fails
Look at the reproduction code and failing inputs
Understand the suggested fix (if provided)
Investigate the Claim.
Search for the function/module documentation
Look for any mentions of the observed behavior
Check if there are known limitations or edge cases
Verify the claimed "correct" behavior matches documentation
Explore the Source Code.
Find the implementation on GitHub or package repository
Check comments for intentional design decisions
Look at recent commits affecting this code
Review the suggested fix for feasibility
Search for existing issues.
Check if this bug is already reported
Look for related discussions or PRs
See if maintainers have commented on similar issues
If found, save the links to include in your response
Run reproduction code. (Optional, but helpful)
If you have a Python environment, try the minimal example
Verify the bug reproduces as claimed
Test edge cases around the failing input
Make Your Assessments

For each question, provide a yes/no answer along with a confidence rating (1-5):
5: Very confident in decision
4: Confident with minor uncertainty
3: Moderate confidence, some ambiguity
2: Low confidence, significant uncertainty
1: Very uncertain, mostly guessing
Is This a Real Bug?

Yes: Violation of documented behavior, mathematical properties, or reasonable expectations
No: This is intended behavior, user error, or misunderstanding.

Consider the following carefully:
Does it violate explicit documentation?
Would a reasonable developer expect this behavior?
Is there a legitimate use case for the current behavior?

Some bugs are boring and not interesting. For example, a function that’s internal to some library and is not user-visible that says it’s supposed to return -1 for an error code but sometimes returns -2 for a different error code probably isn’t a critical bug to file an issue for. In contrast, a user-visible function that says it’s calculating some function but behaves differently (even subtly) might be worth reporting about
In general, use your judgement. If you would file a bug here if you saw this report, you should file the bug.
Would maintainers welcome this bug report?

Yes: Clear, actionable bug with good reproduction that's worth fixing.
No: Trivial, poorly written, already known, or not worth the effort.

You’ll notice that there is a date given to each bug report. It’s fairly recent, but it’s also possible that between then and now a bug fix has been added. Answer as if it is the same day as when the bug report was reported.

Consider the following carefully:
How many users would this affect?
How clear and actionable is the report?
Is the reproduction minimal and reliable?
Does it include a reasonable fix suggestion?
Is it already reported or known?
Is this a Security Issue?

Yes: Could be exploited for harm (data loss, DoS, injection, etc.)
No: No exploitable security implications

Consider the following carefully:
Could this cause data corruption or loss?
Could it be used for denial of service?
Does it bypass security boundaries?
Could it leak sensitive information?
Document Your Reasoning

For each assessment, provide:
Your confidence level (1-5 scale)
Rationale explaining your decision (4+ sentences per rationale)
What resources you checked. Provide exact links to any relevant issues, github discussions, documentation, git history commits, bug reports, related CVEs, (etc.) that informed your rating decision.
Any additional context that influenced your decision. This could be examining the existing test cases, and checking to see if property test violations would be indirectly captured or not already. You might use git blame to scan changes made over time to the code in scope where the property test violation occurred to see if the property violation was due to a recent change or always existed.
Quality Requirements

✓ Check official documentation before marking it as a "real bug". 
✓ Provide clear rationales for each decision
✓ Your justifications are just as important as giving the right answers. Please give your     rationales equal effort and consideration. This is your opportunity to demonstrate your expertise and the value of your professional background.
✓ Link to any existing bug reports or discussions found
✓ Specify which resources you consulted
✓ Be consistent in your evaluation criteria
✓ Be objective in security assessments - don't over-flag
Common Mistakes to Avoid
❌ Assuming all test failures are bugs (some may test incorrect assumptions)
❌ Marking issues as "not real" just because they're edge cases
❌ Over-flagging security issues (they're rare - be objective)
❌ Not checking if the issue is already known/reported
❌ Finding existing reports but forgetting to include the links
❌ Spending too much time on clear-cut cases
❌ Using high confidence when you're unfamiliar with the package domain
Tips for Success

💡 Start with documentation - it's the fastest way to identify intended behavior
💡 Use GitHub's search to quickly find relevant discussions
💡 Focus your time on ambiguous cases; clear bugs/non-bugs should be quick
💡 Be objective when evaluating security implications - these are rare
💡 Use confidence scores to express uncertainty - that's what they're for
💡 For unfamiliar packages, do basic research but reflect uncertainty in confidence scores
💡 Always link to existing reports if you find them - avoid duplicate work
Examples
Example 1: Clear Bug - Negative Values from Positive-Only Distribution

Bug Report Summary: `numpy.random.wald` produces negative values with large mean parameters, violating mathematical definition.

Investigation Results:
- Documentation states Wald distribution only produces positive values
- Mathematical definition confirms x > 0 requirement
- Reproduction confirms negative values generated
- No indication this is intended behavior

Assessment:
- Is this a real bug? YES (confidence: 5)
  - Rationale: Clear violation of mathematical properties and documentation
- Would maintainers welcome? YES (confidence: 4)
  - Rationale: Well-documented, affects correctness of statistical computations
- Security issue? NO (confidence: 4)
  - Rationale: Could cause calculation errors but no direct security exploit
Example 2: Edge Case - Performance Degradation

Bug Report Summary: Function becomes very slow with specific input patterns.

Investigation Results:
- Documentation doesn't specify performance guarantees
- Algorithm has known O(n²) worst case
- Issue tracker has similar report marked "wontfix - documented limitation"
- Found existing issue: https://github.com/example/repo/issues/456

Assessment:
- Is this a real bug? YES (confidence: 2)
  - Rationale: Technically correct but performance is surprising; however, seems to be known limitation
- Would maintainers welcome? NO (confidence: 4)
  - Rationale: Already discussed and decided against fixing (see issue #456)
- Security issue? NO (confidence: 3)
  - Rationale: While could potentially be used for DoS, maintainers aware and accepted risk
- Existing reports: [https://github.com/example/repo/issues/456]
Example 3: Not a Bug - Documented Behavior

Bug Report Summary: Function raises exception for null input.

Investigation Results:
- Documentation explicitly states "raises ValueError for None input"
- Multiple tests verify this behavior
- Design discussion shows this was intentional

Assessment:
- Is this a real bug? NO (confidence: 5)
  - Rationale: Explicitly documented behavior
- Would maintainers welcome? NO (confidence: 5)
  - Rationale: Report misunderstands intended API
- Security issue? NO (confidence: 5)
  - Rationale: Standard input validation
Frequently Asked Questions Make sure to read

Q: What if I can't run the reproduction code?
A: Focus on documentation and source code analysis. Most determinations can be made without execution.

Q: What if I'm unfamiliar with a package?
A: Do basic research (documentation, README, package description) to understand its purpose. You don't need deep expertise - maintainers are the ultimate arbiters. Reflect any uncertainty in your confidence scores.

Q: Should I consider backwards compatibility?
A: Yes - if fixing the bug would break existing code, note this in your assessment of whether maintainers would welcome it.

Q: What if the bug is already reported?
A: Mark as a real bug if it is one, but note in "would maintainers welcome" that it's already known and provide the link(s) to existing reports. This helps avoid duplicate work.

Q: How deep should I investigate?
A: Spend more time on ambiguous cases. Clear bugs or non-bugs should be quick decisions. Aim for reasonable care for a good-faith contribution.

Q: What counts as a security issue?
A: Any bug that could be exploited to: crash systems, corrupt data, bypass access controls, leak information, or consume excessive resources.
